// The colliders follow what is drawn (docs/hitboxes.md), held in node with no browser:
//   - every prop's collision volume against its model, every variant (scripts/hitbox/lib.js): the solid air and the
//     holes stay inside the bounds below, or the prop is on the short list of exceptions, each with its reason;
//   - the rules a prop's colliders keep for the rest of the game: nothing thin enough to be taken for a deck, nothing
//     hung where a jump reaches, a wreck's units told apart on the wire, a variant's colliders for a variant there is;
//   - the report this started from: a shot across the bonnet of the car at camp goes on, one into its cabin stops,
//     nobody walks through the bonnet, and a survivor gets up onto it and from there onto the roof;
//   - a wreck of several boxes is still one thing to strip (two for a lorry), and is found again by its name on the wire;
//   - the whole of both maps swept (scripts/hitbox/sweep.js): no more invisible walls than there are today.
