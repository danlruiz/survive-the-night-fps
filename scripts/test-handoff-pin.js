// A game the new build cannot carry on is carried on by the build that saved it (server/builds.js, rooms.js
// Lobby.afterFailed / Room pin, index.js serving that build's page and files). docs/deploys.md.
//
// Builds before this one are made here: copies of this tree's server/ and shared/, each changed in one way a save
// cannot survive - another map of the same seed (the stalled train's toolbox a metre off), another state version, an
// enum entry this build does not have - each with a client of its own in dist/. A game is played on each, saved by its
// own code, and put in the store with the build that saved it, as a server going down for a deploy does. Then:
//   - the builds themselves: named by their contents; signed with the deploy's key and refused without it, or with
//     another; refused when from before a security fix (SECURITY_EPOCH), of another worker API, or using packages of
//     other versions than this server's; the copy unpacked on disk is checked every time it is used, and written
//     again when anything in it changed; the store keeps a client's files once however many builds have them
//   - a real server of this tree, which can read none of those saves, starts each game's worker from the build that
//     saved it: its players are back in their own bodies; the page for the game's code is that build's client (and says
//     so), /api/version for that game is that build's (so its pages go back in without a reload), its files are served
//     by their names; those games are not in the lobby's list or quick joins
//   - a save that names no build, a build not in the store, or one not signed with this deploy's key: the game ends
//     as before, its players told why
//   - a game kept on an older build closes when its run is over, or at the first dawn after HANDOFF_PIN_MAX_HOURS
//   - (Linux and Windows) the next deploy hands such a game on with the same build named, and the one after carries it on
//     the same way; a server told to stop while it is bringing one back puts the save back
