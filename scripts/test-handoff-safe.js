// Nobody is hurt while they cannot be playing (server/game.js safe / arrived / frozen), on the Game itself.
//
// What happened (6 Oct 2026): a player died "during game updated". A held player was already safe, but the moment
// their reloaded page sent its JOIN they had their body back - and the page then built the valley and its shaders
// for up to half a minute before it drew a frame, with 75 of the dead about. And the restored game ran on all the
// while: the day burned down and the dead closed in round players who were still on their way back.
//
// Here: a night with the dead on top of two survivors is handed over.
//   - the restored game stands still until one of its players is playing again: no clock, nothing moves, nobody hurt
//   - a player who is back but whose client has sent nothing yet is as safe as a held one, for ARRIVE_SECONDS at most
//   - a quarter of a second of commands (or anything they do) and they are playing: the dead go for them again
//   - after an ordinary drop, coming back is safe for no longer than was left of the grace: no new way out of a fight
//   - a deploy straight after a deploy: the same again, however far each player had got
//   - a game nobody comes back to runs on after HANDOFF_FREEZE_SECONDS, and lets its players go as before
