// Deploys without ending the games: the old server saves every game being played when Railway tells it to stop
// (SIGTERM), and the new one, already up, brings each back under the same code. Players are dropped for a moment
// (close code HANDOFF_CLOSE, "Server updating"), reconnect on their own (client/main.js rejoin) and are given back
// their own body, which waited for them where it was (Game.hold / resume).
//
// This file holds what the two servers have to agree on - the shape of a save and the checks that it still means
// the same to this build - and the store a save waits in between them:
//   Postgres (production): one row per game in game_handoff (migration 008), a NOTIFY when one is written, so the
//     new server restores it at once. A server only ever claims a row (DELETE ... RETURNING): one of them gets it.
//   files (development, the tests, a server without Postgres): one file per game in HANDOFF_DIR, claimed by a rename.
// What a game saves, and how it is put back, is server/gamestate.js (Game.save / Game.load).
//
// STATE_VERSION: bump it when a saved field is renamed or removed, or changes meaning or units. A field that is only
// added needs no bump, as long as loading a save without it leaves the default (every entity is restored by building
// a fresh one and copying what was saved over it). A save whose version differs is dropped: that game ends as before.
