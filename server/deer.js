// The valley's deer. Small groups graze the woods and clearings away from the places and the roads, all game, day
// and night. A group bolts as one from a survivor who comes close (closer if they crouch), from a noise that reaches
// it (Zombies.noise hands every noise on to hear) and from the dead; it outruns a sprint, runs a good way and
// settles. They can be hunted: a shot at one goes through the same lag-compensated path as a shot at a zombie
// (Combat.forTargets / hitbox / damageZombie), and a kill leaves leather and venison (DEER_LOOT).
//
// A deer is an entity kind of its own (ENT.DEER, in game.deer), not a zombie: nothing that walks game.zombies - the
// horde's size and waves, the night summary, kills and the leaderboard, the killfeed, the dawn sun, what a noise
// draws, /spawn - ever meets one. Zombies ignore deer; nothing eats anything.
//
// Everything random here comes off the deer's own stream (this.rng), the scatter of a kill's drops included: the
// game's stream is the same with deer in the valley as without.
//
// The mainland's deer are undead (gr.undead, DEER_UNDEAD in the variant, the numbers in UNDEAD): bigger groups - packs -
// that roam at a walk and move on often, fear nothing (no bolt from a survivor, a noise or the dead), and turn on a
// survivor who comes near, shoots one of them or fires close by (MODE.HUNT: watch, hunt, hunting, ram). A kill is still
// on nobody's record; what a ram does to a survivor is on the world's ({ kind: KILLER.WORLD, deer: true }).
