// Dead Hand in a game: survivors play each other at cards, trade, and bet (shared/cards.js is the set, shared/cardgame.js
// the rules, server/usercards.js the collections they keep from run to run). Game.cards; everything a client says
// about it comes in as C2S.CARDS (onMessage) and everything it is told goes out as S2C.CARDS, to that player alone, in
// the same write as the tick's snapshot (send, from Game.sendTick) - and only when it changed: a client whose socket
// is backed up keeps what it is owed until it clears (Game.sendSnapshots skips it).
//
// - Asking. [E] on a standing teammate in reach (Game.reachOf: PICK_RADIUS.MATE at MATE_PICK_Y) asks them for a match
//   (with a deck, and maybe a found card bet) or a trade. An ask lapses after CARD_ASK_TTL; one between the same two
//   at a time, ASK_MAX out at once, one every ASK_EVERY seconds. Both must be survivors on their feet, here, in the
//   day or the night, of different owners (one browser in two tabs is one owner), and neither in a match or a trade.
//   A match is answered whatever has become of the one asked since (they might be down by then).
// - A match. With bets both bet or neither does; the two cards go into an escrow ('m:<match uuid>') before it starts
//   (phase 'locking': the network thread moves them, usercards.js) - one that cannot be had calls it off. Then 'live':
//   shared/cardgame.js plays it, MOVE by MOVE, each naming the version of the table it answers (ver: a stale one is
//   refused and the table sent again). A side's clock stops while that player is away (dropped) or down. It ends as
//   the rules end it, by a forfeit, or by the player leaving (their grace run out, or "Leave game": a forfeit);
//   the bets go to the winner (':pay'), or back on a draw (':back'). The run ending, or the game, voids it: back.
//   MATCH_END goes out once the bets are where they belong ('paying' until then).
// - A trade. Both put found cards and backpack items on their side (OFFER, all of it every time: stored as card ids
//   and ITEM ids with counts, since a backpack's slots move on every pickup); any change takes both sides' READY and
//   CONFIRM back. Struck when both have confirmed: everything is checked again (TRADE_REACH, the cards still theirs,
//   the items still there and room for what comes), the items are taken into the trade's keeping (each with its own
//   magazine or armour points), and the cards are moved by the network thread ('committing') before the items are
//   handed over - or handed back, when that fails. One that is only items is struck at once. TRADE_BREAK apart, or
//   either of them down, dead, one of the dead or away, and it is called off.
// - Packs (ITEM.CARD_PACK, SEALED_PACK: Game.giveItem) are opened as they are picked up: three cards each (rollPack),
//   which go into the finder's collection; they take no room in the backpack. A player with no owner key (no account
//   and no browser id) sees what was in it, and keeps nothing.
//
// Owners: a player's is their rejoinKey ('a:<account id>' or 'g:<sha-256 of the browser id>', Game.handleJoin). The
// network thread is told who is in the game (enter / leave, counted) and answers with each owner's collection (coll),
// which this keeps a copy of (own): what a player may bet, offer or build a deck from is checked against that copy,
// less what they have offered or bet here already (reserved). The network thread checks it all again; a transfer
// that does not hold there is refused and nothing moves. Owner keys never go to a client: players are named by their
// entity id.
//
// Saved with the game (save / load, gamestate.js): the asks, the matches (their engine state is plain JSON), the
// trades being committed (with what they hold) and the transfers under way, which the next server sends again under
// the same id (the ledger applies each once). Not saved: trades still being haggled over (called off), the copies of
// the collections (read again), who has been sent what (everything is sent again as they come back).
// Its own random stream (packs, the boss's sealed pack, the matches' seeds), from the OS's random source: never from
// the map's seed or the tick, which every client is told (WELCOME) - a stream seeded by them would let a player work
// out the seed of their match from their own hand, and from it the other hand and both decks' order. The game's
// (game.rng) is never drawn from either, so a seeded game plays the same with or without cards in it. (A test may
// hand the link a seeded one: link.rng.)
//
// Once the game is saved for the next server (room-worker.js 'save', freeze), nothing a player sends is acted on
// and no pack is opened here: what happened after the save would be lost with this game, while what the network
// thread had been told (cards found, cards traded) would stand.
