// Swimming in the lake and the ponds. Where the water is deeper than a survivor stands, it holds them up with their
// eyes just clear of the surface: to the simulation (playersim.js) the water is a floor at floatY, under the feet of
// anyone over a bed deeper than that, so walking in, floating off the bottom and finding it again on the way out
// are one smooth slope. Afloat, both hands are swimming (nothing in them works), the stride is a stroke, and stamina
// only goes: treading water, swimming, harder on sprint. Out of it the survivor is exhausted and starts to drown
// (the server, Game.updatePlayers) until their feet touch the bottom again - the lake is a way across and a way out
// of a tight spot, never somewhere to sit out a night. The dead don't swim (zombies.js keeps them out of deep water,
// and a turned survivor too: playersim.js).
//
// The mainland's river is not the lake (issue #232): it is fast water. Afloat in it the current carries a survivor
// downstream at RIVER_FLOW and draws them back toward the middle of the channel (riverCurrent: the simulation adds it
// to their own stroke, so the client predicts it), and they drown in seconds (RIVER_DPS, the server) - nobody swims
// across it, and nothing is carried over it but the one bridge.
