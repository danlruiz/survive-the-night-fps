// great many pieces that share a material: drawn as a mesh each they are hundreds of draw calls a frame (and it is
// the issuing of draw calls, not the triangles, that a frame's time on the CPU goes on); drawn as one mesh they
// cannot be culled. A MultiMesh keeps both: its buffer holds a run for every piece, each with its own bounding
// sphere, and what is drawn is the runs that are in the frustum being drawn - picked when three asks the mesh
// whether it is in that frustum (the view's, or a shadow map's: each gets its own list, since the shadow maps are
// drawn between the view's culling and its drawing). three then draws the first run itself and the rest follow in
// one WEBGL_multi_draw call, with the program, the uniforms and the vertex arrays three has just set up.
//
// A run: { first, count (vertices, or indices of an indexed geometry), x, y, z, r (its bounding sphere),
// chunk: { on, near } and maxDist (it is drawn while chunk.on and chunk.near < maxDist: StaticWorld.update) }.
