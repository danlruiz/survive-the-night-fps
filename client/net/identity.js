// and kept in localStorage under 'stn.player'. The server files this player's kills, nights, wins and revives
// under it (server/stats.js).
//
// It is the only thing that proves who the player is - whoever has it plays as them, and spends, trades and bets
// their cards, loadout items and Zombie Skulls - so it goes to the server only inside a socket's JOIN, a JSON body or
// (on a read with no body) the X-STN-Guest header: it is never shown, logged or put in a URL (a query string is kept
// by proxies, the CDN and browser history), and the server never sends it on.
// Clearing the browser's storage makes a new player of this one, and there is no way back to the old record: signing
// in moves it all onto an account (server/auth.js claimGuest), which is why the cards and loadout screens ask guests to.
